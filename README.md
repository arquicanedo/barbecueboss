# Barbecue Boss ConnectIQ App for Garmin Watches.
Barbecue like a boss. An opensource app (https://github.com/arquicanedo/barbecueboss) for barbecue enthusiasts. In the initial version, it provides a searing timer (user-configurable for 1, 2, ..., 5 minutes) and flip confirmation to keep track of your steaks and veggies on the grill. It creates a "barbecue" activity and associates the GPS location to it whenever available.
